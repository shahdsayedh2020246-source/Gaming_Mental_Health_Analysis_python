📊 Gaming & Mental Health — Excel Analytics & Dashboards
Welcome to the Excel Component of the Gaming & Mental Health Analytics project. This directory showcases the foundational data processing, statistical cleaning, and the creation of dynamic, interactive dashboards built entirely within Microsoft Excel and Power Query.

📂 Folder Contents
This folder contains the following core files:

excel file.xlsx: The main working file containing the raw dataset, Power Query transformations, M code logic, and the structured Data Model.
dashboard 1: The first interactive dashboard focusing on Gaming and Player Demographics.
dashboard 2: The second dashboard analyzing Health and Sleep metrics.
dashboard 3: The third dashboard evaluating Addiction risks and Productivity.

(Note: The dashboards are presented as interactive views/images within this directory).

⚙️ Methodology & Technical Highlights
1. Statistical Data Cleaning & Outlier Detection
To ensure the integrity of the analysis, the dataset was evaluated for outliers using statistical rules. Data points falling outside the normal distribution range (Mean ± 3 Standard Deviations) were identified and handled to prevent skewed insights.

2. Feature Engineering (Power Query & M Code)
Significant feature engineering was performed to transform raw metrics into business-ready categories:

Spend Categories: Created dynamic classifications (Low, Mid, High, Very High) for players' total spending using custom M code logic based on calculated averages and standard deviations.
Health & Addiction Metrics: Consolidated multiple binary columns into comprehensive risk indicators (e.g., Physical_Pain index).
Demographic Groupings: Segmented players into distinct age groups and educational states.
3. Data Modeling (Power Pivot Star Schema)
The raw, flat data was normalized and structured into a highly efficient Star Schema within Excel's Data Model:

Created clean dimension tables for Players, Games, Platforms, Sleep State, Addiction, and Physical Status.
Centralized the event data into a single Fact table.
Successfully decoupled games and platforms, eliminating many-to-many relationship issues to ensure fast query performance and accurate cross-filtering.
